"""A command-line utility for using digital signature for a file.

It loads cleartext keys from disk - this is not recommended!

It requires the following arguments:
  mode: either 'sign' or 'verify'
  keyset-file: name of the file with the keyset to be used for the digital
    signature
  data-file:  name of the file with the input data to be signed / verified
  signature-file:  name of the file containing a hexadecimal
  signature of the input file
